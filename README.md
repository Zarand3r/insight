Imagine taking a picture of your notes, or the whiteboard during lecture on your phone, and feeding it into an algorithm that converts the handwritten digits into text. 


char_classifier
===============
Takes image of handwriting from images directory
Uses segmentation to find idividual characters
Finds closest match to each character with classifier
Generates csv to keep track of each character
Outputs converted text

text_classifier
===============
natural language processing, matches with closest word
